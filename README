Wraps virtualenvwrapper's mkvirtualenv and provides a very easy way of creating
development virtual environments for your python projects.

If you cloned some of required packages into the project root and want to use
the cloned versions instead of installing them via pip into the virtual
environment, just list these package names in local-requirements.txt - they
won't be installed, but their paths will be added to PYTHONPATH of the created
virtual environment.
